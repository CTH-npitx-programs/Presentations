All the presentations

## Reqriments
1. 3 things learned in tech
2. 3 things learned in core
3. whatever learned in club and/ or elective
4. favorite memory from this term
	1. must be from this term
5. notes:
	1. do more than just a simple description (like name of module)
	2. recomendations:
		1. Cohen- 1 slide for each point
		2. Charlie- high quality slides. If you want to put all points on 1 slide, make up for the decrease in slide numbers (and, to be fair, decrease in space you can use) via a more interesting, high quality slide.
	3. don't use it as notes per-say. The points should have at least some content, if needed use presenter notes for reminders
		1. for instance, don't just put "I learned about parts of computers". If that's enough of a note to yourself, put that into presenter notes. The main presentation should, while not haveing a block of text, have at least some more
			1. I recommend about 1 to 2 sentences (or a bulleted list with details.
	4. remember to use pictures!
